# use the first three CSV fields for hledger's transaction date, description and amount:
fields date, description, amount

# specify the date field's format - not needed here since date is Y/M/D
# date-format %-d/%-m/%Y
# date-format %-m/%-d/%Y
# date-format %Y-%h-%d

# since the CSV amounts have no currency symbol, add one:
currency $

# set the base account that this CSV file corresponds to
account1 assets:bank:checking

# the other account will default to expenses:unknown or income:unknown;
# we can optionally refine it by matching patterns in the CSV record:
if (TO|FROM) SAVINGS
  account2 assets:bank:savings

if WHOLE FOODS
  account2 expenses:food
